Software Development Technical Challenge

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to work on this software development technical task. The
goal of this task is for you to show your software development knowledge and have a project we
can discuss together and are both familiar with. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, and don’t worry
about making anything pretty, the project just needs to be functional and help show your
understanding of it, not be a beautiful work of art!

Read through the project requirements and specifications below and attempt to satisfy them.
The most important thing is to be able to explain why you made the choices that you did.
Completion of this project should not take more than two hours.

Service: Pokémon Height/Weight Analyzer

Using a language and any libraries, frameworks, etc of your choice, develop a small service that
will determine the average weight and height of a given subset of Pokémon. Use the open
PokéApi (https://pokeapi.co) to pull the data and perform your calculations. There does not
need to be a GUI for this service, a CLI tool is preferred. Upon completion of the project,
push the code to a public GitHub repository and send the GitHub repository link to
kiel.wood@stratusgrid.com.

Requirements & Specifications

The program should:
● Take two CLI inputs: limit and offset
● Query a list of Pokémon from the API using the limit and offset inputs mentioned above
● Query details for each Pokémon to retrieve it’s height and weight
● Calculate an average weight and height for all the Pokémon in the subset queried
● Print the average calculation results to the terminal
● Track the time it takes in seconds to execute the entire service and print to terminal
following the averages
● Add at least one unit test case to the project using a unit testing framework of your
choice
_HINT_ for this challenge, speed/performance is more important than code quality

Bonus Points (not required)
● Develop the program using TypeScript
● Calculate the average weight and height by Pokémon Type in addition to the aggregate
averages
